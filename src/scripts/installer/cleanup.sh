# Bug #578: trailing " start" restricts matches to the long-running daemon

# (cleanup-phantoms, status, stop) running concurrently — the reaper then
# burns 5+s waiting on a process that was already exiting.

# --- 0b. WP #941: MIGRATION_NEEDED gate (hot-swap by default) ---
# Routine upgrades only replace files in src/ (a sibling tree to the mounted
# agent + home overlays). Killing sessions, unmounting overlays, and force-baking
# RAM-to-Flash were downstream consequences of a legacy unmount-during-upgrade
# requirement that no longer exists. Default = hot-swap; the supervisor's
# post-restart bake handles persistence.
#
# Triggers full teardown (legacy "scorched earth" flow below) when:
#   (a) the .migration_required sentinel is present (per-PLG opt-in for ad-hoc
#       breaking changes that don't deserve a layout-version bump), OR
#   (b) the layout-version differs between the old install and the new payload.
#
# Pre-#941 versions never wrote src/.layout-version, so OLD_LAYOUT_VERSION
# defaults to "0" and triggers a one-time migration on first upgrade to v1 —
# correct because the supervisor architecture and overlay paths may have
# drifted across many releases on a long-lived install.
MIGRATION_NEEDED=0
# M4 fix (v2026.05.18.08): sanitize both versions to defend against an
# empty/whitespace-only/non-numeric .layout-version file that would otherwise
# cause a spurious scorched-earth teardown (e.g. `cat` of an empty file yields
# "" which fails the `!= "0"` test and trips the gate). Strip whitespace,
# default empty to "0", validate as pure integer.

# --- Bug #1043 one-off: close pre-TMUX_TMPDIR terminal sessions ------------
# Versions before the private-tmux-socket change kept their sessions in the
# shared /tmp/tmux-<uid> socket; this version uses a plugin-private
# TMUX_TMPDIR, so any such sessions would be silently orphaned by the upgrade.
# Once only — gated by a sentinel, so it runs on exactly the first upgrade that
# carries this code (the transition off the shared socket) — gracefully close
# them: send Ctrl-C twice (the same safe close the UI uses) so each agent
# flushes its state into the home overlay, then kill the session. Runs before
# the hot-swap / full-teardown split so it covers both paths. `env -u
# TMUX_TMPDIR` targets the old default socket location. The sentinel is written
# unconditionally so this never runs again.
