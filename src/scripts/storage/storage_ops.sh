# storage_ops.sh -- Phase 5: the storage OPERATIONS library.
#
# Home/agent storage op bodies, extracted from the former standalone trio
# (mount_stack.sh / commit_stack.sh / consolidate_layers.sh) into SUBSHELL
# functions so storagectl.sh can dispatch to them in-process. Each op is
# `op_X() ( ... )`: the `( )` keeps the moved body's own `set -euo pipefail`,
# `exit` codes, EXIT traps and `flock` fds isolated -- so the extraction is
# behaviour-preserving (the 36-case L3.5 suite is the proof). The trio files
# become thin shims that exec `storagectl <verb>`.
#
# The shared libs (common.sh / resolve_paths.sh / boot_integrity.sh /
# atomic_write_layer.sh) are sourced by each op's body exactly as the original
# scripts did -- idempotent re-sourcing inside the subshell, with the original
# $(dirname "$0") rewritten to $_SO_DIR (this file's dir == the storage dir).
#
# GENERATED from the trio by gen_storage_ops.py, then curated. Re-run the L3.5
# suite after any edit to an op body.
#
# @internal Storage-component internal (Epic #1310). op_mount / op_bake /
# op_consolidate / op_release + the manifest-writer php -r snippets (under the
# bake/consolidate locks) are PRIVATE to the storage component — reached only via
# the storagectl seam behind the FileStorage facade. No consumer shells these
# directly (RegressionGuardsTest enforces it).

# second fuser check before the refresh but left selective_upper_cleanup BETWEEN
# the two checks — a 10-second window during which an agent could launch, then
# the cleanup would remove a file from upper that was in the new lower (but the
# mount wasn't yet refreshed to expose the new lower), causing the file to
# briefly vanish from the agent's view. Restructuring so cleanup runs AFTER
# refresh closes that race: removing files from upper after refresh is safe
# because the new lower (with those files) is exposed.
#
# Why refresh-first is safe: the bake already wrote the new sqsh atomically via
# atomic_write_layer.sh (tempfile + fsync + verify + rename). UPPER is unchanged
# by the bake. Refreshing the mount picks up the new lower without touching
# upper. Then cleanup runs on a mount where the new lower is exposed, so any
# file removed from upper falls through to the new lower (correct content).
#
# Residual race: the umount-remount inside mount_stack.sh has a brief window
# (microseconds) where the mountpoint is unmounted. An agent that launches in
# that exact window still dies with ENOENT. The fuser check below is the
# narrow-window mitigation. A full fix would require per-entity locks that

# process has open files on the merged mount, defer the consolidate rather than
# charging in. Three things go wrong if we ignore this:
#   1. The aggressive pre-bake prune (next block: rm -rf .npm, .cache, .claude
#      caches, etc.) hits files that are open for write by an active agent,
#      tripping `set -euo pipefail` and exiting 1 with no useful diagnostic.
#   2. mksquashfs sees the merged view mid-write and bakes an inconsistent
#      consolidated layer.
#   3. The supervisor counts this as a real failure and after 2 fails halts
#      auto-consolidate with a notification — even though the failure was just
#      a session being active.
#
# Exit 2 signals "deferred / busy" — supervisor treats this as not-a-failure
# and retries on next tick without incrementing the failure counter.
# Epic #1310 / ADR finding #2: use the SESSION-AWARE busy-arbiter, NOT a bare
# `fuser -sm`. A bare fuser only sees open fds/cwd/mmap on the mount and MISSES a
# live interactive session — a ttyd carrying AICLI_HOME=<mount> holds no fd, so
# fuser reads "idle" and consolidate would umount/remount the overlay out from
# under the session. home_mount_in_use (the same arbiter op_bake's reclaim uses)
# combines the fuser fast-path with the ttyd-session scan, so it defers correctly.

# ---- op_graduate  (S-10, Feature #1354) --------------------------------------
# Migrate a flash (layering) entity to the PASSTHROUGH backend on a capable
# device: flush → consolidate to ONE layer → copy into the plain passthrough
# dir → verify → write-ahead intent → MOVE layers to .graduated/ (14-day
# retention, never deleted here) → manifest backend flip + expected-layers
# clear in ONE locked write → clear intent → rebind the mount via the
# passthrough path. Exit contract: 0 ok · 2 deferred (transient; reason
# marker) · 4 precondition failed (reason marker graduate_precondition) ·
# 1 hard failure.
#
# CRASH ARMS (both sides of the manifest write — THE authority flip):
#   • Killed BEFORE the manifest write: the layers are still authoritative.
#     Either they are still on disk (intent written, move not yet done →
#     classifier sees a healthy flash entity; the populated passthrough dir +
#     staging marker are inert garbage a retry converges over) or the single
#     consolidated layer was already renamed into .graduated/ (the intent's
#     "delete" plan marks it an intentional prune, so reconcile never halts;
#     the supervisor's graduate-intent recovery completes the flip forward on
#     the next tick because the verified passthrough copy is populated).
#   • Killed AFTER the manifest write (before clear_intent): passthrough is
#     authoritative — effective_backend un-pins via the recorded backend, the
#     next mount binds the plain dir, and .graduated/ holds the rollback copy.
#     The supervisor's recovery clears the stale intent.
